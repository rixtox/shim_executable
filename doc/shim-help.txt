===============================================================================
 INFO
===============================================================================
This is an application 'shim' that will execute another application (typically
named the same located elsewhere). Execute with --shim-NoOp to identify its
target.

Execute SHIM_EXEC -h or visit https://github.com/jphilbert/shim_executable for
additional information.


===============================================================================
 ARGUMENTS
===============================================================================
The arguments below can be passed to the shim prior to it executing its parent.
They are not case-sensitive and have an equivilent shimgen alias for
Chocolately compatibility.

Technically the arguments need only match "--shim[a-z]*-[hlwegun][a-z]*".

All other argument are passed to the parent executable.

    --shim-Help     Shows this help menu and exits without running the target

    --shim-Log      Turns on diagnostic messaging in the console. If a windows
                        application executed without a console, a file (<shim
                        path>.SHIM.LOG) will be generated instead.
                        (alias --shimgen-log)

    --shim-Wait     Explicitly tell the shim to wait for target to exit. Useful
                        when something is calling a GUI and wanting to block
                        command line programs. This is the default behavior
                        unless the shim was created with the --GUI flag. Cannot
                        be used with --shim-Exit or --shim-GUI.
                        (alias --shimgen-waitforexit)

    --shim-Exit     Explicitly tell the shim to exit immediately after creating
                        the application process. This is the default behavior
                        when the shim was created with the --GUI flag. Cannot
                        be used with --shim-Wait.
                        (alias --shimgen-exit)

    --shim-GUI      Explicitly behave as if the target is a GUI application.
                        This is helpful in situations where the package did not
                        have a proper .gui file. This technically has the same
                        effect as --shim-Exit and is kept for legacy purposes.
                        (alias --shimgen-gui)

    --shim-WdType TYPE
                    Override working directory type: CMD (current directory when
                        shim is run), APP (target's directory), SHIM (shim's
                        directory), or PATH (use directory from --shim-WdPath).

    --shim-WdPath PATH
                    Override working directory path. Used when type is PATH
                        (from embedded config or --shim-WdType PATH).

    --shim-NoOp     Executes the shim without calling the target application.
                        Logging is implicitly turned on.
                        (alias --shimgen-noop)
